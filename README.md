## Overview 🚲

The **Seoul Bike Sharing Demand Prediction** project is aimed at developing a machine learning solution to predict hourly bike rental demand in Seoul. By utilizing environmental, temporal, and categorical features, the project seeks to improve resource allocation for bike-sharing services, reduce downtime, and enhance user satisfaction. The ultimate goal is to help planners effectively manage the bike-sharing system in an urban environment.

## Introduction 📝

Bike-sharing systems have become indispensable in sustainable urban transportation, offering an affordable and eco-friendly solution. Predicting demand is critical for efficient bike-sharing management, as it ensures that bicycles are available when and where users need them.

This project leverages a range of historical data (e.g., environmental conditions, holidays, and hours of operation) paired with advanced machine learning algorithms to forecast hourly bike demand accurately.

---

## Features ✨

- Evaluate correlations between environmental (temperature, humidity), time-based features, and bike demand.
- Predict the hourly bike-sharing demand using machine learning models.
- Identify the factors (like temperature, vacations, and seasons) most affecting bike rental demand.
- Supports planners in optimizing inventory/restocking decisions across the city.

---

## Technologies Used 🛠️

- **Programming Language**: Python 3.8+
- **Development Environment**: Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook
- **Libraries/Tools**:
  - Data Manipulation: `pandas`, `numpy`
  - Data Visualization: `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
  - Machine Learning Models: `scikit-learn`, `xgboost`

---

## Dataset 📂

The project uses a dataset containing the following key attributes:

- **Features**:
  - Date/Hour Information
  - Temperature (°C)
  - Humidity (%)
  - Windspeed (m/s)
  - Is a holiday? (Yes or No)
  - Season (e.g., Spring, Summer)
- **Target Variable**: Number of bikes rented (hourly bike rental counts).

**Source**: Public bike-sharing datasets from Seoul city or other publicly available datasets.

## Getting Started 🚀

### Prerequisites
To get started, ensure the following:
- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab environment for running the project.

### Installation Steps
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sanidhyashekhar/SeoulBikeDemandPrediction.git
   cd SeoulBikeDemandPrediction


## Model Building Workflow 📈

This workflow outlines the steps followed to develop the prediction models:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Analyze the dataset and visualize trends using heatmaps, histograms, and line plots.
   - Evaluate each feature's statistical significance in affecting demand patterns.
   - Handle missing data, remove outliers, and preprocess input features.

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Normalize numeric attributes like temperature and windspeed for uniform scaling.
   - Perform one-hot encoding for categorical variables such as season and holiday.

3. **Model Training**:
   - Different machine learning models are applied, including:
     - **Random Forest Regressor**
     - **XGBoost Regressor**
     - **Gradient Boosting Regressor**
     - **Linear Regression**
   - Train and test the models using an 80/20 train-test split.

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate model accuracy using key metrics like:
     - **R² Score**: Measures how well predictions align with the actual data.
     - **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: Quantifies prediction error.
     - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Indicates the average error in predictions.

5. **Optimization**:
   - Use `GridSearchCV` or `RandomizedSearchCV` to optimize hyperparameters for each model.
   - Identify the best-performing model according to evaluation metrics.

6. **Feature Importance Analysis**:
   - Identify which features (like temperature, holiday, and season) have the greatest impact on bike rental demand.

## Results 📊

Key findings from the project include:

- **Best Model**:  
  Random Forest achieved a high **R² score of 0.89**, indicating strong predictive performance.

- **Feature Importance**:
  - Temperature and seasonality emerged as the strongest predictors of bike rental demand.
  - Holidays and windspeed showed moderate effects on demand patterns.

- **Visualization**:
  - Visualizations showed clear peaks in bike demand during warmer months and working hours.
